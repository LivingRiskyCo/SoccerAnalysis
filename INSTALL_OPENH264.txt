HOW TO INSTALL OPENH264 DLL (to suppress harmless warnings)
===========================================================

The OpenH264 errors you see are HARMLESS - your videos encode correctly with avc1 codec.
This is just to suppress the warning messages.

STEP 1: Download OpenH264 DLL
------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases
2. Scroll down to find the latest release (v2.4.0 or newer)
3. Look for a file named something like:
   - "openh264-2.4.0-win64.dll.bz2" (compressed - needs extraction)
   - OR "openh264-2.4.0-win64.dll" (direct DLL)
4. Download it

STEP 2: Extract (if needed)
----------------------------
If you downloaded a .bz2 file:
- Right-click it → Extract (Windows 10/11 can extract .bz2 files)
- OR use 7-Zip, WinRAR, or similar
- You should get a file named: openh264-2.4.0-win64.dll

STEP 3: Place DLL in correct location
--------------------------------------
Target location: C:\Users\nerdw\soccer_analysis\env\Scripts\

1. Copy the openh264-2.4.0-win64.dll file
2. Navigate to: C:\Users\nerdw\soccer_analysis\env\Scripts\
3. Paste the DLL file there

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- You only need the DLL file, NOT the whole ffmpeg folder
- Place it directly in env\Scripts\, not in a subfolder
- The DLL should be named: openh264-2.4.0-win64.dll (or newer version)

STEP 4: Verify
--------------
After placing the DLL, restart your analysis. The OpenH264 errors should be gone.

If you still see errors, the DLL might be the wrong version. Try downloading
a newer version from the releases page.

ALTERNATIVE: The errors are harmless - you can ignore them!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Your videos encode correctly with the avc1 codec even without OpenH264.
The warnings are just informational messages from FFmpeg.
