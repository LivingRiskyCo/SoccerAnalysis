GUI Dialog Components

Note: Many dialogs are standalone files that are opened from the main GUI.
This module provides a central location for dialog-related imports and utilities.

# Common dialogs that are opened from the main GUI:
# - analytics_selection_gui.py (AnalyticsSelectionGUI)
# - setup_checklist.py (open_setup_checklist)
# - combined_color_helper.py (CombinedColorHelper)
# - goal_area_designator.py (designate_goal_areas_interactive)
# - calibrate_field_gui.py (FieldCalibrationGUI)

# These are kept as standalone files for now as they are large and self-contained.
# Future refactoring could extract them here if needed.
